# The following commands copy the output from the "build" stage above and tell
# the container runtime to execute it when the image is run. Ideally this stage
# contains the minimal runtime dependencies for the application as to produce
# the smallest image possible. This often means using a different and smaller
# image than the one used for building the application, but for illustrative
# purposes the "base" image is used here.
